## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Verify equation creation doesn't make impossible to guess questions ( [ ] * 0 = 0 , 0 * [ ] = 0)
* [ ] Fix dividing handling ( 4 / [] = 1, inputting "4" is somehow incorrect?)
* [ ] Complete program documentation.
* [ ] Add handling of negative numbers.
