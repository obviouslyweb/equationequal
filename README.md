## Overview

**Project Title**: EquationEqual

**Project Description**: EquationEqual is a math equation quizzer, allowing you to test your knowledge on short math problems. The game will continue to prompt and quiz you on simple "number operator number" style math questions, asking you to fill in the missing number. You can customize the bounds of the problems generated, as well as reattempt missed problems. The bounds you set and any missed questions you have are saved to your computer, allowing you to return and reattempt between sessions.

**Project Goals**: Learn and understand the Java runtime envoirnment and utilize such knowledge to create a dynamic math equation game with save/load functionality.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

# Using Command Prompt, Terminal, or equivalent
1. Download the repository contents to your computer. You can either download the repository contents as a .ZIP file, or use git / GitHub Desktop to copy the repository to your device.
2. Open a Command Prompt, Terminal, or equivalent program on your device.
3. Navigate to the "equationequal" folder (using `cd` on Windows).
4. Type `java main.java` to start the program.

# Using Visual Studio Code
1. Download the repository contents to your computer. You can either download the repository contents as a .ZIP file, or use git / GitHub Desktop to copy the repository to your device.
2. Open Visual Studio Code, and open the folder containing the project.
3. Open `main.java` and press the Play button in the upper-right corner. The program will run using the terminal built into Visual Studio Code.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Java Tutorial - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [Random Number Library in Java - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-random-numbers-in-java/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Verify equation creation doesn't make impossible to guess questions ( [ ] * 0 = 0 , 0 * [ ] = 0)
* [ ] Fix dividing handling ( 4 / [] = 1, inputting "4" is somehow incorrect?)
* [ ] Complete program documentation.
* [ ] Add handling of negative numbers.
